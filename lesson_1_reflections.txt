How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me spot the line where the mistake was and after careful examination, spot the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   I wouldn't have to repeat the same mistakes if I new what worked in previous versions. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Ideal versioning. You make a commit when you think it is necessary. Sometimes, it can be hard because you forget that you have to save. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git treats multiple file commits as a logical entity that is commited. Fro Gdocs or sth similar this doesn't hold.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    It is easy to do it, git log shows the commits and git diff shows the specific changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
